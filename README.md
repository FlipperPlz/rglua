This is a crate that contains bindings for using the lua c api in garrysmod through bindings using the rust libloading library.
Can be used for either binary modules or just manual injections into gmod, like with [Autorun-rs](https://github.com/Vurv78/Autorun-rs)

This works by finding a ``lua_shared.dll`` file relative to the currently running program, so you need to make sure your file is either in ``GarrysMod/bin/`` or ``GarrysMod/garrysmod/bin`` for srcds servers. The library will panic if the file is not found.

More information on binary modules can be found on the garrysmod wiki: [Creating Binary Modules](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Creating_Binary_Modules) and an example [can be found here.](https://github.com/Vurv78/rglua/tree/master/examples/is_even)
## Usage
If you are targeting 32 bit make sure to install the toolchain and build to it:
```bash
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --release --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc
```
## Acknowledgements
### [garrysmod_common](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common)
This is heavily based off of garrysmod_common, in how we export the lua_shared functions and trying to replicate everything from the Lua C Api.
